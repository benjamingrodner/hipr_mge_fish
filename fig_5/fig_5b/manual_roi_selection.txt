## Pre-processing

1. Did max projection on each channel in spectral images, then created a new stack from the images and did max z projection on the new stack. Saved max projection to \\cbsuvlaminck2.biohpc.cornell.edu\workdir\bmg224\manuscripts\mgefish\outputs\fig_5\fig_5b

2. Loaded airyscan image and split stack into images, then closed the spot channel (channel 2)

3. Went to Process../enhance contrast in FIJI and picked 1% saturated for both images. Selected equalize histogram on airyscan image. 

## ROI selection 

1. Select ROI in airyscan image using freehand selection tool, add to roi manager (t), go to tab Edit/Selection/Create Mask, save tiff as SAMPLE_roi_#### to \\cbsuvlaminck2.biohpc.cornell.edu\workdir\bmg224\manuscripts\mgefish\outputs\fig_5\fig_5b\roi_masks\20222_03_19_plaqueplasmidamr_sample_hs_probe_mefe_fov_tile1_round_1_mode_airy_Airyscan_Processing_stitch

2. Select same ROI in spectral image and save with same roi ####

3. Repeat. 

4. If you want to edit an roi save as same number plus "alt"

5. For extra unpaired rois present in one image (spectral) but not the other, marked as 'unpaired'
